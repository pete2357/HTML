            Formula One is a single seater open wheel motorsport. The cars are powered by a 1.6L V6 Hybrid engine. The power unit consists of 6 parts, they are Internal Combustion Engine, Motor Generator Unit - Kinetic, Motor Generator Unit - Heat, Energy Storage/Battery, Control Electronics and Turbocharger, every team is allowed to change these components which are in their component-pool, any additional component outside of pool, would lead to a grid penalty. There is one another component known as Gearbox, which can be changed after every 6 races, without any penalty
